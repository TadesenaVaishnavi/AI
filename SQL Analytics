Q1) explaination
This query finds customers who had more than 3 late payments in the last 6 months. It selects each customer’s ID, 
counts their late payments from the transactions table in the recent 6-month window, groups by customer, and shows only those with a count greater than 3.

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS late_payments
FROM transactions
WHERE payment_status='late' 
  AND payment_date > DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING late_payments > 3;

p1)SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS late_payments

“I’m asking for two columns: the customer’s ID and a count of how many matching rows (late payments) they have. 
I name that count late_payments so the result is readable.”

p2) FROM transactions

“All data comes from the transactions table — each row

p3)WHERE payment_status='late'

“I filter to only include rows where the payment was recorded as late — we don’t want on-time transactions.”

p4)AND payment_date > DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)

“I further restrict to payments that happened after the date six months ago — so we focus on recent behavior, not old history.”

p5)GROUP BY customer_id

“Since we want a count per customer, I group all transactions that belong to the same customer_id so the COUNT(*) gives each customer’s total late payments.”

p6) HAVING late_payments > 3

“HAVING filters the grouped results. Here I keep only customers whose late_payments count is greater than 3 — i.e., repeat offenders in that 6-month window.”

p7)Final result (plain):

“The output lists customers who were late more than three times in the last six months, along with how many late payments each had.”


2) top 5 high spent 
explintion :
This query finds the top 5 customers who spent the most in the last 6 months based on their total transaction amount.”

FROM clause

FROM transactions

This specifies the table we are using, which is the transactions table containing all customer transactions.

WHERE clause

WHERE transaction_date > DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)

Filters transactions only from the last 6 months.

CURDATE() returns today’s date.

DATE_SUB(..., INTERVAL 6 MONTH) subtracts 6 months from today.

So only transactions after that date are considered.

SELECT clause with aggregation

SELECT customer_id, SUM(transaction_amount) AS total_amount

For each customer, we calculate the total transaction amount using SUM().

We also select customer_id to know which customer the total belongs to.

AS total_amount gives a name to the calculated sum for readability.

GROUP BY clause

GROUP BY customer_id

Aggregation functions like SUM() require grouping.

Here, we group all transactions by customer so that we can sum each customer’s transactions separately.

ORDER BY clause

ORDER BY total_amount DESC

Sorts the results in descending order by total transaction amount.

The customer with the highest total comes first.

LIMIT clause

LIMIT 5

Returns only the top 5 customers from the sorted list.

This ensures we get only the customers who spent the most.
