**Computer Vision** 
is a field of AI that enables computers to **see, understand, and interpret(analysis) images or videos like humans do.**

What is a CNN?
-----
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model that is very good at 
looking at pictures and understanding what's inside.
Just like humans use their eyes and brain to recognize objects (like cats, cars, or people), 
CNNs help computers recognize things in images.

CNN is like a brain for images. It helps computers see and understand pictures — whether 
it’s a photo of a cat, an X-ray, or a traffic light. Today, CNNs are used everywhere: phones, 
hospitals, cars, and more!

4 main steps
~~~~
Convolution Layer (Feature Detector) - This layer looks at small parts of the image, like checking for edges, corners, or 
colors.
It uses something called filters to find these features.
 Example: Detects the edge of a cat’s ear or the corner of a box

ReLU Layer (Activator)
After finding features, it removes all negative values.
 This helps the network focus only on the useful information.

Pooling Layer (Compressor)
t shrinks the image, keeping only the important parts.
 Helps reduce memory and makes the system faster.
 Think of it like zooming out a bit to see the big pictur

Fully Connected Layer (Decision Maker )
It takes all the information found and makes the final decision.
 Example: “Yes, this is a cat (or) NO
Applications:
Image Classification - It says what is in the image.
Object Detection - Finds where the object is in the image.
Image Segmentation - Colors each part of the image with a label(assign a name).

CNN learns automatically.
It works faster and better than old methods.
It remembers patterns in images just like we do.

Normalization

Batch Normalization
Layer Normalization
Instance Normalization
Group Normalization
Weight Normalization
Spatial Normalization

**Batch Normalization** – Normalizes the data for each layer using the average and variance of the current batch to make training faster and more stable.

**Layer Normalization** – Normalizes all the neurons in a single layer for each data point, helping especially in recurrent or transformer models.

**Instance Normalization** – Normalizes each image (or instance) separately, often used in style transfer tasks.

**Group Normalization** – Divides channels into small groups and normalizes each group, useful when batch size is small.

**Weight Normalization** – Normalizes the weights of neurons instead of the inputs to make learning more efficient.

**Spatial Normalization** – Normalizes over spatial dimensions (height and width) to balance brightness or contrast across images.




What is an RNN? RNN = Recurrent Neural Network
----
An RNN is a type of neural network designed to process sequential data.
Input → [RNN Cell] → Output

 Hidden State (Memory)
What is Sequential Data?
Sequential data is data that has a specific order, and the order is important.
Examples:
 Text (sequence of words)
 Speech (sequence of sounds)
 Stock prices (sequence over time)
 Video frames (sequence of images)
 Sensor data (from smart devices over time)

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
----
It is the training method used to update the weights of an RNN
sentence: I like deep learning
The RNN sees one word at a time: First: "I" Then: "like" Then: "deep" Then: "learning"
