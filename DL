What is Sequential Data?
Sequential data is data that has a specific order, and the order is important.
Examples:
 Text (sequence of words)
 Speech (sequence of sounds)
 Stock prices (sequence over time)
 Video frames (sequence of images)
 Sensor data (from smart devices over time)

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
----
It is the training method used to update the weights of an RNN
sentence: I like deep learning
The RNN sees one word at a time: First: "I" Then: "like" Then: "deep" Then: "learning"
